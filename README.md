Walkie TalkieðŸ¤–

What is Walkie Talkie?
Walkie Talkie is a platform that generates a route for the user based on their preferences and location. It also provides an audio guide for each location that they will visit

Motivation:
Planning a route to visit places in an unfamiliar city can be daunting for a tourist. In addition, audio guides often come with a reasonable cost. Therefore, we wanted to create a platform that does both tasks and with a cheaper cost as well

How to run it:
Visit (whatever url we register)
